    </p>

    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¾ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed</li>

      <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, divided</li>

      <li>salt to taste</li>

      <li>1 cup yogurt</li>

      <li>tablespoons ginger garlic paste</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>

      <li>1 ½ teaspoons garam masala</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Directions</strong>

    <ol>
      Make marinade: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Add 1
      tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon chili powder, and salt; stir to
      evenly coat chicken. Cover the dish and let marinate in the refrigerator
      for about 1 hour.
    </ol>

    <ol>
      1.Line a strainer with cheesecloth. Place yogurt in the strainer and allow
      it to drain for 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer drained yogurt to a medium
      bowl. Mix remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oil, garlic paste, ginger
      paste, melted butter, remaining 1 tablespoon chili powder, and garam
      masala into yogurt until well combined. Pour yogurt mixture over chicken,
      cover the dish, and refrigerate once more to marinate for 3 to 4 hours.
    </ol>

    <ol>
      2.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
    </ol>

    <ol>
      3.Place chicken on skewers; arrange in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
    </ol>

    <ol>
      4.Bake in the preheated oven until almost cooked through, about 20
      minutes.
    </ol>

    <ol>
      5.Make sauce: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in
      garam masala. When masala begins to crackle, mix in ginger paste, garlic,
      and green chile pepper. Sauté until tender, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in tomato
      purée, water, chili powder, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low
      and simmer, stirring in honey and fenugreek.
    </ol>

    <ol>
      6.Remove par-cooked chicken from skewers and place into sauce in the pan.
      Continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes.
      An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
      165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stir in cream until incorporated.
