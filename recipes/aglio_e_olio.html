    <p>
      No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the
      classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect
      golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
      flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.
